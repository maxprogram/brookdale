#### The Space
A startup house in the heart of Mountain View, home of Gōōgle, LìnkēdIn, Y Combinator, WhatsApp, 500 Startups, the Computer History Museum, and more. We live in a FANTASTIC location, with the best of both worlds: very close to popular Silicon Valley spots but still quiet and cozy. Both YC and 500 Startups are a ~10 minute bike ride away.

You’ll sleep on a comfy mattress in a [[room shared with 1 other person]] in a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house. We have everything needed for your stay including fresh towels, sheets, shampoo, and breakfast in the morning.

You'll have desk space with a 100Mbps WiFi connection, or you can work at any number of coffee shops or the MV Public Library all walkable in 15 minutes. We also have our own mini-library with great books to read and places to read them.

WHO WE ARE
We are a group of entrepreneurial friends from around the world who wanted to have a place to call home in the Valley. Here’s some of the things we’re working on: advanced computer vision, machine learning, disrupting Google PageRank, creating a crowdsourced historic map of the world, immersive VR entertainment, etc.

#### Guest Access
Full kitchen including common food items (milk, eggs, bread, condiments, etc.), laundry room (washer, dryer, iron/board), backyard, common area, and desk space.

#### Interaction with Guests
We are all engineers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts. If you're working on something interesting we would love to talk with you about it, but you are free to communicate as you wish.

We’ll have movie nights, BBQ nights, and other get togethers on occasion that you’re more than welcome to join.

Don’t hesitate to ask us about the area — we can help you meet people, show you the best places to go, and more.
